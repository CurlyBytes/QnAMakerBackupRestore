# QnAMakerBackupRestore
Backup and restore your Azure search index which is part of the QnAMaker runtime

Since Azure search does not have an in-place SKU upgrade, to upgrade your QnAMaker stack you can use this code to restore your knowledge base data to the upgraded Azure search SKU.

See [here](https://aka.ms/qnamaker-docs-qnamaker-upgrade) for more details.
